abstract: Lewisite, a chemical warfare agent, induces severe skin injury by oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction, necessitating innovative antidote strategies. 
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study developed chitosan nanoparticle-loaded foam formulations for rapid decontamination and sustained 4-PBA delivery to treat Lewisite-induced skin injury. Optimized nanoparticles (N35) showed high stability, reduced drug permeation, and effective skin retention. In vivo, the N35 + NAC formulation significantly protected against arsenical-induced injury and inflammation, demonstrating strong therapeutic potential and translational feasibility for chemical burn treatment.
