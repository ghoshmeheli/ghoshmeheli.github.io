abstract: Lamotrigine, a first-line treatment for epilepsy, has been shown to effectively reduces seizure frequency and severity. However, its current oral dosage form presents limitations such as polypharmacy, polyphagia, poor patient compliance, and adverse systemic effects. In this study, a matrix-type transdermal patch was investigated for continuous lamotrigine delivery over three days. Various penetration enhancers were screened, with a combination of oleic acid and oleyl alcohol proving most effective. Suspension-based transdermal patches were formulated using acrylate and polyisobutylene (PIB) pressure-sensitive adhesives, with or without propylene glycol (PG), in different thicknesses via solvent evaporation. Optimized patches (P1-P5) were characterized for adhesive properties, drying time, peel strength, tack, shear strength, and drug content uniformity. In vitro permeation studies were conducted using Franz diffusion cells with porcine ear skin and human epidermis over 72 h. A developed HPLC method was used to quantify drug permeation. Passive delivery through PG alone was found to be insufficient (23.36 ± 5.6 μg/sq. cm). The 400 GSM PIB patch with PG and chemical enhancers (P5) delivered the highest amount of lamotrigine (498.70 ± 43.15 μg/sq. cm) across porcine skin, exceeding the target for pediatric patients aged 2–12 years. This formulation demonstrated potential as a pediatric anti-epileptic patch, offering improved treatment options for epilepsy.
