abstract: Lewisite, a chemical warfare agent, induces severe skin injury by oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction, necessitating innovative antidote strategies. This study developed chitosan nanoparticle-loaded foam formulations for rapid skin decontamination and sustained topical delivery of 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), an ER stress-reducing chaperone. Nanoparticles were synthesized via ionic gelation using low (LMW) and medium molecular weight (MMW) chitosan. The optimized formulations, N31 (LMW) and N35 (MMW), achieved drug loadings of 5.04 % and 10.09 % w/w, particle sizes of 141.88 ± 26.31 nm and 176.10 ± 36.97 nm, monodisperse distributions (PDI < 0.3), high entrapment efficiency (>93 %) and good stability with zeta potential of −16.67 mV and −19.37 mV, respectively. Incorporation into foam enabled both effective decontamination (>70 % efficiency) and sustained 4-PBA delivery. In vitro release studies demonstrated sustained drug release over 24 h. P

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study developed chitosan nanoparticle-loaded foam formulations for rapid decontamination and sustained 4-PBA delivery to treat Lewisite-induced skin injury. Optimized nanoparticles (N35) showed high stability, reduced drug permeation, and effective skin retention. In vivo, the N35 + NAC formulation significantly protected against arsenical-induced injury and inflammation, demonstrating strong therapeutic potential and translational feasibility for chemical burn treatment.
