## Sustained Delivery of 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) through Chitosan Nanoparticles in Foam Formulation for Decontamination and Treatment of Chemical Warfare Agent-Induced Skin Injury

•	Formulated and characterized 4-PBA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles and incorporated these in a foam formulation

•	Compared two different molecular weights of chitosan on the formation of 4-PBA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles and their effect on the release (IVRT) and delivery (IVPT) of 4-PBA for up to 24 hours

•	Tested the efficacy of the foam formulation with or without the nanoparticles in decontamination of lewisite from skin

## Development of 4-Phenylbutyric acid-loaded emulsomes embedded in foam for the decontamination and treatment of lewisite-based skin injury

•	Formulated and characterized novel 4-PBA-loaded emulsomes and incorporated these in a foam formulation

•	Tested the efficacy of the foam formulation with or without the 4-PBA loaded emulsomes in decontamination of the lewisite from the skin

## Development of 4-phenylbutyric acid microsponge gel formulations for the treatment of lewisite-mediated skin injury

•	4-PBA loaded eudragit RS100 microsponges were developed, characterized, and incorporated in gel formulation

•	Two gelling agents, carbopol and carboxymethylcellulose were compared on the formulation of the gels, characterizations (rheological tests, texture analysis, pH, microscopic evaluations), and the release (IVRT) and delivery (IVPT) of 4-PBA for up to 24 hours

•	Follicular delivery of 4-phenylbutyric acid PLGA nanoparticles to mitigate chemical warfare agent-induced skin injury: a quality by design approach

•	Formulation and characterization of 4-phenyl butyric acid loaded PLGA nanoparticles using DOE and analyzing their deposition in the hair follicles using differential tape stripping in full-thickness porcine skin (after IVPT)

## Conducted stability studies following ICH guidelines to compare the micro/nanoparticulate systems

•	Accelerated stability studies for 6 months are being conducted on all the nano/microparticulate systems for 4-PBA delivery following ICH guidelines to compare the formulations

## Topical foam for Simultaneous Treatment and Decontamination of Chemical Warfare Agents on Dermal Exposure

•	Editing and review of the manuscript

•	Authored annual reports and technical communications for all these NIH grant projects.
