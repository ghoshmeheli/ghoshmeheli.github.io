*We developed a novel dual-action topical foam with 4-PBA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles that combines rapid arsenical decontamination with sustained antidote delivery for lewisite skin injuries.*

## Purpose:

Lewisite, an arsenical chemical warfare agent, induces severe skin injury through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation following accidental or intentional exposure. Due to the inadequacy of current treatments, there is an urgent need for a novel antidote. This study repurposes 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), an FDA-approved chemical chaperone for urea cycle disorders, as a promising antidote that mitigates ER stress and inflammation by inhibiting the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, thereby facilitating repair of lewisite-induced skin injuries. 
However, 4-PBAâ€™s rapid transdermal absorption limits its sustained therapeutic effect at the injury site. To address this, we developed a novel topical foam containing 4-PBA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (NPs), designed to provide dual action: rapid decontamination of arsenicals from the skin, followed by controlled local antidote delivery. This dual-function approach aims to significantly enhance therapeutic efficacy against lewisite-induced skin injuries.


## Methods:
Chitosan NPs were synthesized via ionic gelation using low (LMW, 50â€“190 kDa) and medium molecular weight (MMW, 190â€“310 kDa) chitosan. Critical formulation parameters, drug to polymer ratio (1:2 to 2:1), Pentasodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) crosslinker concentration (0.04â€“0.12% w/v), TPP injection rate (0.5â€“2 mL/min), and stirring speed (500â€“800 rpm), were systematically optimized. Chitosan dissolved in acetic acid (pH 4.5) was combined with 4-PBA (50 mg/mL in ethanol) under controlled stirring (650 rpm), followed by dropwise TPP addition to induce NP formation. NPs were washed, lyophilized, and characterized for size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, drug loading (HPLC), and entrapment efficiency (Table.1). Optimized formulations (N31: LMW; N35: MMW) were incorporated into a non-propellant topical foam (F39), comprising 15% Tween 20, 10% ethanol, 5% oleic acid, and 70% propylene glycol, designed for effective lewisite decontamination from skin with easy application that requires no rubbing.
In vitro release testing (IVRT) was performed using a dialysis membrane (14,000 kDa) to assess the release kinetics of 4-PBA from each formulation. In vitro permeation testing (IVPT) utilized Franz diffusion cells with dermatomed human (n=4) to quantify cumulative 4-PBA permeation over 24 hours using HPLC. NPs in PBS or F39 were compared to free 4-PBA controls. Lag time for drug permeation was calculated. Decontamination efficiency was evaluated using phenyl arsine oxide (PAO) as a lewisite surrogate, and the impact of PAO exposure on subsequent 4-PBA permeation was assessed. Nanoparticlesâ€™ stability under accelerated conditions (40Â°C/75% RH and 25Â°C/60% RH) was also evaluated. Statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA with Tukeyâ€™s post hoc test (p<0.05).


## Results:

Optimized nanoparticles (N31 and N35) were spherical with 141.88 Â± 26.31 nm and 176.10 Â± 36.97 nm size, respectively, monodisperse distribution (PDI <0.3), and moderate negative zeta potentials (N31: -16.67 mV; N35: -19.37 mV), indicating good colloidal stability. Drug loading was higher for MMW chitosan (N35: 10.09% w/w) than LMW (N31: 5.04% w/w), with both demonstrating high entrapment efficiency (>93%). FTIR analysis confirmed the preservation of 4-PBAâ€™s major functional groups and indicated strong drug-polymer interactions, while differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed amorphization of 4-PBA within the nanoparticle matrix, supporting sustained release. Stability studies revealed no significant drug loss or chemical degradation over 30 days at room temperature.
IVRT demonstrated sustained release from both N31 and N35 nanoparticles, with N35 releasing 65.6% and N31 releasing 18.1% of encapsulated 4-PBA over 24 hours, compared to 72.0% from free 4-PBA in foam. IVPT revealed that free 4-PBA in foam F39 achieved the highest cumulative permeation (348.10 Â± 5.37 Âµg/cmÂ² at 24 h), while N35 in F39 delivered 214.35 Â± 16.6 Âµg/cmÂ² (38.4% reduction) and N31 in F39 delivered 64.90 Â± 6.89 Âµg/cmÂ² (81.35% reduction). Both NPs significantly prolonged lag time (N35: 4.89 Â± 0.70 h; N31: 7.90 Â± 0.94 h) compared to free drug (0.93 Â± 0.27 h). The foam vehicle itself did not impede drug permeation, as the cumulative 4-PBA permeation in the PBS control (280.64 Â± 30.69 Âµg/cmÂ²) was not statistically different from that of 4-PBA in F39. This indicates that the observed sustained permeation was attributable to the incorporation of 4-PBA into nanoparticles, rather than the foam vehicle. Decontamination studies demonstrated that foam F39 and NP-loaded foams maintained >70% decontamination efficiency, with no significant reduction upon NP incorporation. In PAO-exposed skin, both N35 and N31 foams retained sustained permeation (N35: 158.54 Â± 53.93 Âµg/cmÂ²; N31: 138.25 Â± 14.72 Âµg/cmÂ² at 24 h).


## Conclusion:
We developed a novel dual-action topical foam with 4-PBA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles that combines rapid arsenical decontamination with sustained antidote delivery for lewisite skin injuries. This innovative formulation overcomes current treatment limitations by controlling drug release and maintaining high decontamination efficiency, representing a significant advance toward effective chemical threat countermeasures.
