## Purpose:

Quercetin, a prominent flavonoid within the flavonol subclass, is widely present in the diet and offers several potential benefits, including antioxidant, antiviral, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anticancer properties. Despite its wide pharmacological profile, quercetin faces challenges such as poor gastrointestinal retention, low skin penetration, limited water solubility, low bioavailability, and stability issues which restrict its therapeutic efficacy.

To overcome these limitations, poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers were used as carriers for quercetin in this study, leveraging their properties as excellent solubilizers and permeation enhancers for many hydrophobic drugs such as quercetin for its increased topical and transdermal delivery and in turn enhancing its therapeutic effects. Our study aims to incorporate quercetin quercetin-loaded PAMAM dendrimers into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel and compare the topical and transdermal delivery efficiency of two half-generation PAMAM dendrimers (G1.5 and G3.5).

## Methods:

Solubility studies of quercetin in PAMAM dendrimers were done by adding excess quercetin to deionized water containing increasing concentrations of the PAMAM dendrimer (G1.5 and G3.5). The suspensions were sonicated briefly and stirred at 37°C at 1200 rpm overnight. After equilibration, the formulations were centrifuged at 13400 rpm for 10 minutes and filtered through 0.22 μm pore size nylon membranes. The quercetin concentration in the samples was determined using a validated HPLC method.

Quercetin-loaded PAMAM dendrimer (G1.5 and G3.5) complexes were prepared by adding quercetin (15 mg) dissolved in methanol to a methanolic solution of the PAMAM dendrimers (1 μM). The suspension was stirred overnight at 1200 rpm and then dried under vacuum to remove the methanol. To this, 5 mL of distilled water was added, and the system was stirred for another 12 hours to extract the quercetin-PAMAM dendrimer (Q-PAMAM) complex. The solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm pore size nylon membrane to remove free quercetin and then lyophilized to remove water completely. The formed Q-PAMAM complex were characterized for particle size, drug loading, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, stability and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 

A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel was prepared using 12% w/v PVA [1.41353 PVA 40 - 88 grade] in deionized water at 400 r.p.m maintained at 95°C, for 4 hours until a homogeneous solution was formed. The solution was further blended with low shear mixing overnight using a rotary mixer to form the gel. The formed Q-PAMAM complex were incorporated into this PVA gel.

Q-PAMAM-loaded PVA gels and Q-PAMAM suspensions were further tested for in vitro permeation using vertical Franz diffusion cells using a dermatomed porcine ear skin model (n=4). Each formulation, consisting of 100 μL of gel or suspension in propylene glycol (PG) containing 2 mg of quercetin, was applied to the skin. These formulations were compared to a passive control group (quercetin dissolved in propylene glycol [PG]). Additionally, the same groups were subjected to in vitro release studies using cellulose dialysis membranes (MWCO 14000 Da) (n=4). Receptor samples were collected at predetermined time points over 24 hours, and both skin and receptor samples were analyzed for quercetin concentrations.

## Results:

The solubility of quercetin increased linearly at lower concentrations (up to 1μM), beyond which the increase was no longer linear (Fig. 3b).  Formulations Q-G1.5 and Q-G3.5 were prepared and characterized as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Q-G1.5 and Q-G3.5 exhibited mean particle sizes of 75.29 ± 0.66 nm and 188.07± 3.01 nm, respectively, with both demonstrating a PDI of 0.3 according to dynamic light scattering results. The solubility profile  ofof quercetin in presence of G-1.5 and G-3.5 increased linearly at lower concentrations (up to 1μM), beyond which the increase was no longer linear (Fig. 3b).  

Passive delivery of quercetin through PG was notably lower (5.03 ± 1.17 µg/sq.cm for 24 hours) compared to other quercetin-loaded PAMAM dendrimer formulations (Fig. 3d), indicating the barrier-altering and solubilizing properties of PAMAM dendrimers. The total delivery of quercetin across porcine ear skin from Q-G3.5 in PVA gel was the highest (97.93 ± 3.92 µg/cm2) among all groups. The accumulation in skin layers was also higher in the case of the quercetin-loaded dendrimer formulations when compared to the passive group with the highest accumulation in the epidermis and dermis. In the release study, 84.74% of quercetin was released in 24 hours from Q-G3.5 in PVA gel compared to a 55% in Q-G1.5 in PVA gel, further supporting the enhanced delivery of quercetin from G3.5 compared to G1.5. These findings indicate that the quercetin loaded PAMAM dendrimer successfully enhanced the permeation of quercetin into and across the skin for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

## Conclusion: 

Quercetin-loaded PAMAM dendrimers were successfully prepared, characterized, and incorporated into PVA gel. Formulations Q-G1.5 and Q-G3.5 demonstrated enhanced delivery of quercetin across dermatomed porcine skin for up to 24 hours, with Q-G3.5 exhibiting superior efficacyhigher delivery compared to Q-G1.5. The gel facilitated the development of an easily applicable formulation without significant alteration in quercetin delivery. Thus, we demonstrated the feasibility of developing a quercetin loaded PAMAM dendrimer formulation for enhanced delivery of quercetin, potentially for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.
